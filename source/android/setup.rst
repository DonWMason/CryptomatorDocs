Setup
=====

You can get Cryptomator for Android on

* `Google Play <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.cryptomator&hl=en>`_
* `APK Store <https://cryptomator.org/android/>`_ 
* `F-Droid repository <https://static.cryptomator.org/android/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=F7C3EC3B0D588D3CB52983E9EB1A7421C93D4339A286398E71D7B651E8D8ECDD>`_

As for the functionality of Cryptomator, the application does not differ using Google Play or the APK Store as installation type. Google Drive is excluded from the F-Droid version because Google Drive needs proprietary dependencies which doesn’t fit to the spirit of F-Droid.

The APK Store and F-Droid variant of Cryptomator was created to serve users who do not have Google PlayStore installed on their Android device.
If you have a Google PlayStore on your device, we recommend using the PlayStore version of Cryptomator.


Google PlayStore
------------------

If you have installed Cryptomator via the Google PlayStore, you will receive updates as usual via the Google PlayStore. 

After buying the app using Google PlayStore, it can be used with any number of devices that you have linked to the google account from your purchase. Furthermore it supports the "Google Play Family Library" function which means that the app can be used by up to 5 people in a family without having to buy it again. The conditions and how to create a “Google Play Family” can be found here: https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7007852?hl=en

Sometimes the Google PlayStore has problems to recognize that the app was already bought and asks you to buy again the app, see this topic to recover from this problem: `On how many devices can the app be installed using Google Play Store? <https://community.cryptomator.org/t/on-how-many-devices-can-the-app-be-installed-using-google-play-store/6129>`_


APK Store
------------

The APK store version can be installed from our website `https://cryptomator.org/android/ <https://cryptomator.org/android/>`_. Please verify the `SHA256 Signature` after downloading the APK before installing. The download is a so-called `APK` (Android application package), which is an installation archive. Install the app by simply clicking on the APK. 
It is possible that the app in which you clicked on the APK is asking for "Install from Unknown Sources" permission, this is normal and must be activated for a short time (it is recommended to remove the permission afterwards).

This version does include an automatic updater that periodically checks if there is a newer version of this app, and if so, it can be downloaded and installed directly from within the app. Using the :ref:`Update Check Interval <android/settings/update-check-interval>` in the Cryptomator settings, you can specify how often the update check is executed.

As this version wasn't bought using Google's PlayStore you need to buy a license key from our website `https://cryptomator.org/android/ <https://cryptomator.org/android/>`_. After Cryptomator is installed, you have to enter this key. This can be done by copying and pasting the license into the field when asked for it or by clicking on the link starting with `cryptomator://license/YOUR_LICENSE_KEY`.

F-Droid repository
-------------------

The F-Droid version can be installed after adding our F-Droid repository to the F-Droid app by opening `this link <https://static.cryptomator.org/android/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=F7C3EC3B0D588D3CB52983E9EB1A7421C93D4339A286398E71D7B651E8D8ECDD>`_ on the device or scanning the following QR-Code:

As well as using the APK Store variant because this app version wasn't bought using Google's PlayStore you need to buy a license key from our website `https://cryptomator.org/android/ <https://cryptomator.org/android/>`_. After Cryptomator is installed, you have to enter this key. This can be done by copying and pasting the license into the field when asked for it or by clicking on the link starting with `cryptomator://license/YOUR_LICENSE_KEY`.
